## Shapes of D4 unit lattices
In an upcoming preprint, our [research group](https://sites.google.com/view/rethinkingnumbertheory-5/projects#h.y5ua03l3zj5o) explores the **shapes of unit lattices** of quartic $D_4$ number fields. 

  - *In our early investigations our group ran a series of computational experiments over various families of number fields. We noticed interesting constraints on the geometry of unit lattices for this family. These constraints appeared to arise due to the symmetries of this family (i.e. the $D_4$ galois group encodes the symmetries of a square).*

  - These initial computational experiments helped inform our development of the theory and while the paper is still being polished I have posted some spoiler code here. It is not perfectly clean (so experimenter beware!) but as time goes on I will refine and restrcture this folder up. 

*Spoiler alert!* The plot below shows the distribution of unit shapes ordered by absolute discriminant, the constraint forces the lattices to lie on the boundary of the fundamental domain!
